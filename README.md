## How to Run Locally
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aliulmurtazaalvi/todesktop-landing.git
   cd todesktop-landing
   ```
2. **Open the Project**:
   - Since this is a front-end-only prototype, no server setup is required.
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser:
     ```bash
     open index.html
     ```
     Alternatively, use a local development server for a better experience:
     ```bash
     npm install -g live-server
     live-server
     ```
3. **View the Page**:
   - The landing page will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5500` (or the port provided by `live-server`).
